My aim was to code a simple but fun game, I used to play a lot of arcade and DOS games when I was younger.

Tetris can be fun and addictive, with more levels and difficulty added but I wanted to begin by getting the Javascript functionality working well and then style it with some DOM Manipulation and learn some new ways to add sound effects to make it more interactive for the user.

Using Google Chrome Web Dev browser tools, I've realised that my Tetris game needs some media queries for smaller mobile screens,
so that will be a problem I can solve with more research.

I hope you enjoy it!
